In simple words, a Javascript engine is the one in charge of interpreting and executing javascript code.
There are several engines on the market today, one of the most popular is [V8](https://v8.dev/).
V8 is an [Open Source](https://github.com/v8/v8) engine used by Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers and tools.

Today it is the most used Javascript engine, let's see their uses and benefits...

### The V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for their Chrome browser. V8 compiles JavaScript code into machine code, which can then be executed by the computer's processor. This process is what makes V8 so fast and efficient it allows JavaScript code to be executed much more quickly than it would be if it were interpreted by the browser.

### Node.js and V8

Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, meaning that it uses V8 to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. This enables developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, allowing them to build fast, scalable, and efficient web applications. Because Node.js uses V8, it inherits many of V8's benefits, including high performance and efficiency.

### Other uses

Although Node.js is the most popular use case for V8, it is not the only one. V8 is also used by other projects, including:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Couchbase
- Electron
- and more

### The Benefits of Using Node.js and V8

By using Node.js and V8 together, developers can take advantage of the following benefits:

1. High Performance: V8's ability to compile JavaScript code into machine code allows Node.js to execute JavaScript code much more quickly than it would be able to otherwise. This makes Node.js a great choice for building applications that require high performance.
2. Scalability: Node.js is designed to be scalable, meaning that it can handle large amounts of traffic and requests without slowing down. This makes it a great choice for building applications that need to be able to handle a lot of users.
3. Efficiency: Because Node.js uses JavaScript on the server-side, developers can use the same language on both the client and server-side, which can save time and increase efficiency. Additionally, Node.js is known for its ability to handle I/O operations efficiently, making it a great choice for building applications that require a lot of I/O.

### Conclusion

Node.js and V8 are two powerful technologies that work together to enable developers to build fast, scalable, and efficient web applications. By taking advantage of V8's high performance and efficiency, Node.js has become a popular choice for building server-side applications. If you're looking to build a fast, scalable, and efficient web application, Node.js and V8 are definitely worth considering.
