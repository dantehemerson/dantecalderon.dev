I want to share you the tools that I use in my professional work.

I work mainly with Node.js, C++, and recently I started learning Ethereum, so I'm using Solidity as well. As you will see, some of tools and configurations listed here, wil be related to these technologies.

  I'm a big fan of mechanical keyboards, brown switches are my favorites. This is the last one I acquired and the first with Cherry MX switches and I am totally fascinated with the quality and the typing experience.
