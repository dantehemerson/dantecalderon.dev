Sometimes when you are developing your client components on SSR components you are developing you get an error similar to this:


```basic
ReferenceError: window is not defined
```


This is a typical error when you try to use the `window` global variable on SSR code, that is because `window` only exist on the **browser**, not in the server. 


### Solution:


There is a simple solution for this, to use a conditional for that, let’s say:


```javascript
export function MyComponent() {
	
	useEffect(() => {
		window.addEventListener(...
	}, []);

	return <div>Hello</div>
}
```
