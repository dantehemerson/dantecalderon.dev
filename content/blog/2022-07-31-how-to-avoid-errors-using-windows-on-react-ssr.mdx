Sometimes when you are developing your React components on SSR frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), you run into this error:


```yaml
ReferenceError: window is not defined
```


This is a typical error when you try to use the `window` global variable on the server, that is because `window` only exists on the **browser,** not on the server. And in the compilation time, we get that error.


### Solution:


Fortunately, there is a useful library that helps us solve this issue easily, it’s called [browser-monads-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-monads-ts), you only need to install it and import and use it in your component like this:


```javascript
// Import window from the browser-monads-ts library
import { window } from 'browser-monads-ts';

export function MyComponent() {
	
	useEffect(() => {
		// You can use window anywhere in your code
		window.addEventListener(...
	}, []);

	return <div>Hello</div>
}
```


What this library does is when it is on the client it will return the real value of `window` otherwise it will return a non-functional value preventing you from getting a **reference error**.
